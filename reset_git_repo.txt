In a good workflow your remote copy of master should be the good one while your local copy of master is just a copy of the one in remote. Using this workflow you'll never get this message again.
If you work in another way and your local changes should be pushed then just git push origin assuming origin is your remote
If your local changes are bad then just remove them or reset your local master to the state on remote git reset --hard origin/master
